Python indeed has "buffer protocol", but its data model is exactly what you would expect of buffer

continuous memory block with starting address and length. Anything else would be to slow for a "buffer". 
CPython buffer protocol is described here: https://docs.python.org/3/c-api/buffer.html , and MicroPython's 
is the same in spirit, but unbloated and simplified.
